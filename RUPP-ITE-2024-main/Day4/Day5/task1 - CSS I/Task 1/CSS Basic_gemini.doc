CSS: Cascading Style Sheets
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language used to style HTML elements. It controls the layout, design, and appearance of a web page. Think of it as the "makeup" for your web content.

Role of CSS in Web Development:
Separating Content from Style: CSS allows you to keep the structure (HTML) of your web page separate from its presentation (CSS), making it easier to maintain and update.
Consistent Appearance: By applying styles to multiple elements, you can ensure a consistent look and feel throughout your website.
Responsiveness: CSS can be used to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
Enhanced User Experience: Well-designed CSS can improve the user experience by making the website visually appealing and easy to navigate.
Creating a Simple HTML Document with CSS
HTML Document (index.html):

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Simple Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

CSS Stylesheet (styles.css):

CSS
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 40px;
}

p {
    color: green;
    font-size: 20px;
}
Use code with caution.

Explanation of CSS Code:
body selector: This targets the <body> element of the HTML document.
background-color: lightblue;: Sets the background color of the entire page to light blue.
h1 selector: This targets all elements with the tag <h1>.
color: red;: Sets the color of the <h1> text to red.
font-size: 40px;: Sets the font size of the <h1> text to 40 pixels.
p selector: This targets all elements with the tag <p>.
color: green;: Sets the color of the <p> text to green.
font-size: 20px;: Sets the font size of the <p> text to 20 pixels.
When you open the index.html file in a web browser, you'll see the text "Hello, World!" in red and a larger font size, and the paragraph text in green and a smaller font size, all on a light blue background. This demonstrates how CSS can be used to style HTML elements to create a visually appealing web page.
