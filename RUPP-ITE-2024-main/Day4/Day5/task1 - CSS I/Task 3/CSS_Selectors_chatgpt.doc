What Are CSS Selectors?
CSS selectors are patterns used to select and target HTML elements that you want to style. They tell the browser which elements the CSS rules should apply to. There are different types of selectors that offer varying degrees of specificity, allowing for fine-tuned control over styling.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selector: Targets all elements of a specified type (e.g., p, h1, div).
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specified class attribute (e.g., .class-name).
ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific id attribute (e.g., #id-name).
Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on their attributes and values (e.g., [type="text"]).
Pseudo-Class Selector: Targets elements in a specific state (e.g., :hover, :first-child).

Explanation of CSS Selectors and Their Usage
Element Selector (h1):

Targets all <h1> elements in the document.
CSS Rule: color: darkblue; changes the text color of all <h1> elements to dark blue.
Class Selector (.highlight):

Targets any element with the class attribute class="highlight".
CSS Rule: background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold; adds a yellow background and bold text to any element with this class. In the example, the second paragraph is styled.
ID Selector (#main-title):

Targets the element with the specific ID id="main-title". IDs must be unique within the page, meaning this selector will only affect one element.
CSS Rule: font-size: 28px; text-transform: uppercase; changes the font size and transforms the text to uppercase. The rule only affects the <h1> element with the ID main-title.
Attribute Selector (input[type="text"]):

Targets all <input> elements where the type attribute is set to "text".
CSS Rule: border: 2px solid green; padding: 5px; adds a green border and some padding to all text input fields. In this case, the input field for the "Name" label is styled.
Pseudo-Class Selector (a:hover):

Targets an <a> (anchor/link) element when the user hovers over it with the mouse (:hover).
CSS Rule: color: red; changes the link color to red when the user hovers over it. In the example, hovering over the link triggers this style.
Pseudo-Class for nth-child (ul li:nth-child(odd)):

Targets the odd-numbered <li> elements within an unordered list (ul) using :nth-child(odd).
CSS Rule: background-color: #f0f0f0; adds a light gray background to every odd list item, giving the list a striped effect.
Summary of Selectors and Their Benefits
Element Selector: Useful for applying styles to all elements of the same type (e.g., all paragraphs or headings).
Class Selector: Ideal for applying styles to multiple elements with the same class, offering more flexibility and reusability.
ID Selector: Used for targeting a specific, unique element, perfect when you need to style a single element differently from others.
Attribute Selector: Useful for targeting elements based on specific attribute values, such as styling input fields or links differently based on their type or href.
Pseudo-Class Selector: Enables dynamic styling of elements in specific states, such as when a link is hovered, or a form element is focused.
By combining these selectors, you can target different elements effectively and achieve precise control over how your webpage looks and behaves.
