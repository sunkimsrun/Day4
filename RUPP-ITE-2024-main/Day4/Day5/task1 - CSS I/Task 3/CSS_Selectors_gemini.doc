CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements to which styles should be applied. They act as a way to identify elements based on their tags, classes, IDs, attributes, or other criteria.

Types of CSS Selectors
Element Selectors: Target elements based on their tag name.

Example: h1 targets all <h1> elements.
Class Selectors: Target elements with a specific class attribute.

Example: .my-class targets all elements with the class "my-class".
ID Selectors: Target a single element with a unique ID attribute.

Example: #my-id targets the element with the ID "my-id".
Attribute Selectors: Target elements based on their attributes.

Example: [href] targets all elements with an href attribute.
Pseudo-Class Selectors: Target elements based on their state or position.

Example: :hover targets an element when the mouse hovers over it.
