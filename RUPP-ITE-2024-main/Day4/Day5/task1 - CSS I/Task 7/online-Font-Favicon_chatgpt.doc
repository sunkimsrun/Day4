What are Online Fonts?
Online fonts, also known as web fonts, are fonts that are hosted on the web and can be integrated into a website by loading them from a third-party service (such as Google Fonts). This allows developers to use a wide variety of fonts in their websites without relying on fonts installed on the user's device.

Web fonts improve the aesthetics of a website by allowing custom typography, which can enhance branding and design consistency.

How to Integrate Google Fonts in an HTML Document
Google Fonts is a popular, free service that provides access to a wide range of web fonts that can be easily integrated into a website. Here's a step-by-step guide to using Google Fonts:

1. Select a Font from Google Fonts
Go to the Google Fonts website.
Browse through the available fonts and select one (or more) that you like.
Once you've selected a font, click on the "Select this style" button, and Google will generate a link that you can use in your HTML file.
2. Link Google Fonts in HTML
To use the selected Google font, include the link in the <head> section of your HTML file.

Example HTML using Google Fonts:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Google Fonts Example</title>
    
    <!-- Google Font: Roboto -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
        }
        
        h1 {
            font-weight: 700; /* Bold weight */
        }

        p {
            font-weight: 400; /* Regular weight */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Using Google Fonts</h1>
    <p>This page is styled using the Roboto font from Google Fonts.</p>

</body>
</html>
Explanation:
The <link> element in the <head> section loads the Google Font "Roboto". The wght@400;700 specifies the regular (400) and bold (700) font weights.
In the CSS, the font-family property is set to 'Roboto', sans-serif to apply the font to the entire document.
What is a Favicon?
A favicon (short for "favorite icon") is the small icon that appears in the browser tab, bookmarks, or next to the website's URL in the address bar. It serves as a visual identifier for a website and enhances branding.

Favicons are typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels in size and are usually in .ico, .png, or .svg formats.

How to Add a Favicon to a Web Page
To add a favicon to a web page, you need to use the <link> element inside the <head> section of your HTML document. Here’s how to do it:

Example HTML for Adding a Favicon:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Favicon Example</title>
    
    <!-- Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Adding a Favicon</h1>
    <p>Check the browser tab to see the favicon.</p>

</body>
</html>
Explanation:
The <link rel="icon"> tag specifies the favicon for the website. The href attribute points to the location of the favicon file (in this case, favicon.ico). The type="image/x-icon" defines the MIME type for the icon file.
Note: You can use other image formats like .png or .svg if supported by the browser:

html
Copy code
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.png" type="image/png">
Combining Google Fonts and Favicon in One HTML File
Here’s an example of a web page that integrates both Google Fonts and a favicon:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Google Fonts & Favicon Example</title>
    
    <!-- Google Font: Open Sans -->
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    
    <!-- Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

    <style>
        body {
            font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
        }
        
        h1 {
            font-weight: 700;
            color: darkblue;
        }

        p {
            font-weight: 400;
            color: #333;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>Google Fonts & Favicon Demo</h1>
    <p>This page uses the Open Sans font and has a custom favicon. Check the browser tab to see the favicon.</p>

</body>
</html>
Conclusion
Google Fonts allows you to use a wide range of web fonts in your website by simply linking to them via a URL, offering more design flexibility than system fonts.
Favicons enhance user experience by adding a visual identifier for your website in browser tabs and bookmarks.
Both Google Fonts and favicons are easy to integrate and play a crucial role in branding and improving the visual appeal of websites.
