Online Fonts
Online fonts are font files that are hosted on a remote server and can be accessed and used on websites without needing to be downloaded and installed locally. This offers the advantage of providing a consistent font experience across different devices and browsers.

Using Google Fonts
Google Fonts is a popular service that provides a vast library of free, high-quality fonts. To use Google Fonts in your HTML document, follow these steps:

Choose Fonts: Visit the Google Fonts website (fonts.google.com) and select the fonts you want to use.
Generate Code: Click the "Select" button next to each font, then click the "View Code" button. This will generate a <link> tag that you need to include in your HTML document's <head> section.
Include in HTML: Paste the generated <link> tag into the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto|Open+Sans">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph using Google Fonts.</p>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

In this example, the Roboto and Open+Sans fonts from Google Fonts are included in the <head> section. You can then use these fonts in your CSS styles.

Favicons
A favicon is a small image that appears in the browser's tab or address bar, representing your website. It helps users identify your site among others.

To add a favicon to your website, create a small square image (typically 16x16 or 32x32 pixels) and save it as a .ico file. Then, include the following <link> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document:

HTML
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">
Use code with caution.

Replace favicon.ico with the actual name of your favicon file.

Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Website</title>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
    </body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

By following these steps, you can easily integrate online fonts like Google Fonts and add a favicon to your website, enhancing its visual appeal and branding.
