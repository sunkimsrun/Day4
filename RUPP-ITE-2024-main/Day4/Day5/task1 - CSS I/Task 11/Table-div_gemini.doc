Tables vs. <div> Elements for Layout
Tables were traditionally used for layout in HTML, but they are not the ideal solution for this purpose. They are designed to present tabular data, not for creating complex layouts.

<div> elements are more flexible and versatile for layout. They can be combined with CSS to create various layouts, including grids, columns, and other arrangements.

When to Use Tables
Presenting Tabular Data: Tables are best suited for organizing and displaying data in rows and columns, such as spreadsheets or schedules.
When to Use <div> Elements
Creating Custom Layouts: <div> elements provide greater flexibility for designing complex layouts, including grids, columns, and responsive designs.
Semantic Structure: Using <div> elements with appropriate class names can improve the semantic structure of your HTML, making it easier to understand and maintain.
Example: Table vs. <div> Layout
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Layout Example</title>
    <style>
        table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }

        th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 8px;
        }

        .container {
            display: flex;
            justify-content: Â  
 space-between;
        }

        .item {
            width: 300px;
            border: 1px solid #ccc;
            padding: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Table Layout</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Product</th>
            <th>Price</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item 1</td>
            <td>$10</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Item 2</td>
            <td>$20</td>
            <td>3</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Div Layout</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="item">Item 1</div>
        <div class="item">Item 2</div>
        <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
Table Layout: The table is used to present data in rows and columns. The border-collapse: collapse property merges cell borders for a cleaner appearance.
Div Layout: The .container div uses display: flex to create a flexible layout. The .item divs are placed side-by-side with equal spacing using justify-content: space-between.
In conclusion, while tables can be useful for presenting data in a structured format, <div> elements offer greater flexibility and control for creating custom layouts. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach, you can choose the most appropriate method for your specific needs.
