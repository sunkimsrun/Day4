Styling Text and Fonts in CSS
CSS provides a wide range of properties to control the appearance of text on web pages. Here are some common properties and an example demonstrating their usage:

Common Text Properties
font-family: Sets the font family to be used for the text.
font-size: Sets the size of the text.
font-weight: Sets the boldness of the text (e.g., normal, bold, bolder).
text-align: Sets the alignment of the text within its container (e.g., left, center, right).
color: Sets the color of the text.
text-decoration: Adds decorations to the text (e.g., underline, line-through).
Example HTML Document
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Text Styling Example</title>
    <style>
        h1 {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            font-size: 36px;
            font-weight: bold;
            text-align: center;
        }

        p {
            font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
            font-size: 18px;
            color: #444;
            text-align: justify;
        }

        a {
            color: blue;
            text-decoration: underline;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Link to Example Website</a>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

Explanation
h1: Sets the font family to Arial (or a similar sans-serif font if Arial is not available), the font size to 36 pixels, the font weight to bold, and the text alignment to center.
p: Sets the font family to Verdana (or a similar sans-serif font), the font size to 18 pixels, the color to a dark gray (#444), and the text alignment to justify (which aligns the text to both the left and right margins).
a: Sets the color of links to blue and underlines them.
This example demonstrates how CSS can be used to customize the appearance of text elements on a web page, making it more visually appealing and readable. You can experiment with different combinations of properties to achieve the desired style for your content.
