CSS Box Model
The CSS box model is a conceptual representation of how elements are laid out on a web page. It consists of four main components:

Content: The area that contains the actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The outline or edge of the element.
Margin: The space outside the border, separating the element from other elements.

CSS box model with content, padding, border, and margin
The total width of an element is calculated as:

width = content + padding (left + right) + border (left + right) + margin (left + right)
Similarly, the total height is calculated using the same formula with top and bottom values.

Example HTML Layout and Styling
HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>CSS Box Model Example</title>
    <style>
        .box {
            width: 200px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 2px solid black;
            padding: 10px;
            margin: 20px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box">Content</div>
</body>
</html>
Use code with caution.

In this example:

The .box element has a width of 200px and a height of 100px.
A 2-pixel black border surrounds the content.
There is a 10-pixel padding between the content and the border.
The element has a 20-pixel margin on all sides, creating space between it and other elements.
