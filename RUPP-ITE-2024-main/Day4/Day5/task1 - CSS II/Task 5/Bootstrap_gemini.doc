Bootstrap: A Responsive Web Design Framework
Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components for building responsive, mobile-first web applications. It offers a wide range of pre-designed elements, such as buttons, navigation bars, forms, and more, that can be easily customized to fit your specific needs.

How Bootstrap Aids Responsive Design
Grid System: Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts. It uses a 12-column grid that can be customized to fit different screen sizes. This ensures that your website looks great and functions well on all devices.
Pre-built Components: Bootstrap provides a vast library of pre-built components that are already optimized for responsiveness. This saves time and effort, as you don't have to start from scratch for every element.
Utilities: Bootstrap includes a variety of utility classes that can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of elements. These classes can be used to control spacing, alignment, colors, and more.
A Simple Bootstrap Layout
Here's a basic HTML structure using Bootstrap components:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">   

  <title>Bootstrap Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">   

</head>
<body>
  <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
    <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
    <button class="navbar-toggler"   
 type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-controls="navbarNavAltMarkup" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
    </button>
    <div class="collapse   
 navbar-collapse" id="navbarNavAltMarkup">
      <div class="navbar-nav">
        <a class="nav-item nav-link active" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
        <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
        <a class="nav-item nav-link" href="#">Pricing</a>
        <a class="nav-item nav-link disabled" href="#">Disabled</a>
      </div>
    </div>
  </nav>   


  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">   

        <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Primary</button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-secondary">Secondary</button>
      </div>   

      <div class="col-md-4">
        </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
