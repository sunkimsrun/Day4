Sass: A Superset of CSS
Sass is a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of standard CSS by adding features like variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more. It allows developers to write CSS in a more organized, efficient, and maintainable way.

Key Differences Between Sass and Regular CSS
Variables: Sass allows you to define variables to store values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to manage and update styles.
Nesting: Sass supports nested rules, which can improve code readability and organization. You can nest selectors within other selectors, creating a hierarchical structure.
Mixins: Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS code that can be included in multiple places. This helps reduce code duplication and makes it easier to manage styles.
Functions: Sass provides built-in functions and allows you to define custom functions to perform calculations or manipulate values.
Partials: Sass uses partial files (files with a _ prefix) to organize your stylesheets into smaller, more manageable components. These partials can be imported into other files.
Example: Sass File Demonstrating Nesting, Partials, and Imports
styles.scss:

SCSS
@import "partials/base";
@import "partials/buttons";

.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;

  .button {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none; Â  

    cursor: pointer;
  }
}
Use code with caution.

partials/base.scss:

SCSS
$primary-color: #007bff;
Use code with caution.

partials/buttons.scss:

SCSS
.button {
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

Compiled CSS:

CSS
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.container .button {
  background-color: #007bff;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 5px;
}
Use code with caution.

Notable Differences from Standard CSS
Nested Rules: The Sass code uses nested rules to define the .button class within the .container class. This improves code readability and organization.
Partials and Imports: The Sass file imports partial files (base.scss and buttons.scss) to organize the code into smaller, reusable components. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
Variables: The $primary-color variable is defined in the base.scss partial and used in the buttons.scss partial. This allows you to easily change the primary color throughout your stylesheet.
Compiled CSS: The compiled CSS output flattens the nested rules and replaces the variable with its value. This results in standard CSS that can be understood by browsers.
As you can see, Sass provides a more efficient and organized way to write CSS, making it easier to manage and maintain large-scale projects.
